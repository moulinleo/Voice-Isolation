For demo of the voice separation, run "demo.py"

Requirements:
- python 3.6
- Tensorflow
- librosa
- keras
- winsound

The demo.py function loads the pretrained model (CNN.json) and its weights (model.h5) to perform voice separation. 

The other files are dependent on the dataset (which has been removed) to run.
